# LED-blinking-one-by-one-using-Arduino-
This is a basic LED blinking program and circuit design which is created on Tinkercad using Arduino board.                                       

Problem Statement - Four LED Blinking using Arduino
This simple project comes under Basic Arduino Programming
following Steps are required for understanding code.

Step 1- Import the required libraries. 
Step 2- Decide pins for input and output.
Step 3- In void loop write LED High and low as per pin given , also give delay.
